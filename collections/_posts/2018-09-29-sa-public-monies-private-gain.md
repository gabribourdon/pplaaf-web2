That embattled CEO of the Public Investment Corporation, Dan Matjila, may be negotiating a golden handshake to leave, as reported by the South African newspaper Mail & Guardian, is worrying, said today the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF).

The PIC is a state owned company that holds more than R2 trillion (121 billion EUR) in assets and comprises the sole asset manager serving the country’s public sector. Some 98% of value owned or overseen by the PIC belongs to the South African Government or its employees, including dozens of social security, pension, provident and other funds. The PIC’s largest client is the R700 billion (42 billion EUR) Government Employee Pension Fund (GEPF).

The potential negotiation may take place despite the Commission of Inquiry, appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa; an ongoing forensic investigation and whistleblower-related cases into alleged improprieties, corruption and illicit transactions involving companies and senior members of the country’s ruling party, the African National Congress.

“_Such a deal would be a travesty of justice and a slap in the face of efforts to ensure accountability in South Africa_”, said Henri Thulliez, a board member of PPLAAF. “_The Budlender Inquiry currently looking into the wrong-doing at the PIC, including serious and detailed accusations against Mr. Matjila, which PPLAAF has seen, should be allowed to runs its course._”

While the Gupta’s were the brazen face of state capture, it is alleged that billions of rands worth of loans provided under Matjila’s watch to politically exposed persons were soft so that they were practically gifts. The value of the pension funds of tens of thousands of public servants has been diminished as a result to enrich a new Broederbond (band of brothers).
Mr. Matjila would be leaving the PIC in the wake of the dismissal of at least one brave whistleblower, Simphiwe Mayisela, and the ongoing disciplinary hearing of the company secretary who stands accused, essentially of exposing some of the rot. This includes the alleged doctoring of minutes of the PIC board minutes to cover up nepotism and corruption.

“_We call on President Ramaphosa to prevail upon the Board, reverse the dismissal and stop the victimization of alleged whistleblowers so that they may freely participate in the Budlender Inquiry investigating corruption at the PIC,_” added Thulliez. “_The President must consider interrupting the exit of Mr. Matjila at the further expense of pensioners and public confidence in the new dawn. Wrongdoing in state agencies and parastatals should be prosecuted and not result in golden handshakes._”
